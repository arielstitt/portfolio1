## Blockers

When I initially started this project, I used grid for the first time. Little did I know, grid was a new technology that had very little features. For instance, using animation on grid was not possible at the time, creating bugs and defects through out the project. 


## Future Plans 

The purpose of this simplified project was to play with color schemes and to use vanilla js for a mock portfolio website. I'm going to use React for the real portfolio website and use this as a possible template for other projects to track my progress.

## Wins 

I was able to add a smooth scroll-spy which I always thinks looks nice when other websites implement it.

I was able to use grid successfully for the tech that was available at the time.
